    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements keep going on the same line, while block elements break to a new line. 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    It is removed from the normal flow and sits on its own layer. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    Give it a class, select that class using a period in CSS, then set the width.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.
    block level: div, p, h1
    inline: span, a, img

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    The box model is a model that shows you the spaces around elements and what that space is called.
    The fix is the height and max-width property being added to the parent element.
